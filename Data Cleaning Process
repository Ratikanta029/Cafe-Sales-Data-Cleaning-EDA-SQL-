Data Cleaning Steps

Check for duplicates
CLEAN AND FILL MISSING VALUES in the columns
Deleted Rows with missing values as they represent a very small (0.4%) for the total data
REPLACED INCONSISTENT VALUES IN PAYMENT_METHOD WITH 'UNKNOWN'
REPLACED INCONSISTENT VALUES IN LOCATION WITH 'UNKNOWN'
Replaced Null values in Transaction_date with '1900-01-01' - Default date
